About this Repo
===============
This repo contains the [NODE](http://nodesensors.com) Android library, as well as an open source example application.

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found [here](http://variabletech.bitbucket.org/framework/android/doc)

About the Demo Application
===============
The library demo application located in this repo uses a compiled JAR, which can be 
downloaded separately from the 
[downloads section](https://bitbucket.org/variabletech/libnode-android-public/downloads). 
The demo application shows how to capture and display Motion, Clima, Oxa, Chroma and Therma data from a NODE device. 

Compatible Devices
==================
The library and bluetooth implementation has been tested on the following devices:
	
	* Samsung S3 & S4 
	
	* HTC One X (Developer Edition)
	
	* HTC One X (Consumer Edition)
	
	* Nexus 7 (1st Gen & 2nd Gen)
	
	* Droid X (1st Gen) [This API Example Only]
	
	* Samsung Galaxy S2

However, the NODE Android library is compatible with Bluetooth-enabled Android devices running Android version 2.3 or higher. 

Build Requirements
===================
* Android 4.3 API level 18 or above
* JRE / JDK 1.7

Troubleshooting
==================

* An application compiles and will push to the device.
However, the application throws an error with the message "Unable to Instantiate Activity. . ." 
Fix: You may need to check the version of Java that you are building IDE is using (Needs to be Version 1.7).


* Upon importing code into Android Studio, an IllegalStateException is thrown. 
Most of the time, recompiling will get fix this error.
